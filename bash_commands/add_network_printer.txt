# Simple script to automatically add printers from a print server to OSX

# Get a list of printers from the print server (you need the tools installed):
# smbclient -U username -W AD_server -L print_server

# PPD's are 'driver' files that let you connect and set printer options
PPDPATH="/Library/Printers/PPDs/Contents/Resources/"


# This function looks up the PPD options available to the specified printer
printerOptions(){
	PRINTER="$1"

	lpoptions \
		-p "$1" \
		-l
}

# use AUTH=negotiate for kerberos
# AUTH=negotiate
# default to AUTH=none so the user is prompted for creds

AUTH=none

# This function finds and adds the printer with the PPD file
printerOptions(){
	PRINTER="$1"
	PPD="$2"

	lpadmin \
		-p "$1" \
		-v "smb://print_server/$PRINTER" \
		-P "$2" \
		-E \
		-o printer-is-shared=false \
		-o auth-info-required="$AUTH" \
		"$3"
	sudo killall -HUP cupsd
}

# Here is an example call - call printerOptions and use printer name as the
# argument to get a list of PPD options

printerOptions "Name_of_the_printer"

# Here is an example call = call addPrinter and use printer name as the first
# arg, Use the $PPDPATH variable as shortcut to Mac's standard ppd path as 
# second arg, Third Arg is optional for printer specific options.
